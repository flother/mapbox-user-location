# Tracking user location with Mapbox GL JS

This repo contains a simple test of the support for the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation) in [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) v1.13.1. You can view the demo at [flother.github.io/mapbox-user-location](https://flother.github.io/mapbox-user-location/). Tap or click the little "target" icon in the top-right corner and then bike/scoot/drive around your environment. The map will follow your location as you go. To see how it's done, read the documentation on the Mapbox GL JS [`GeolocateControl`](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/markers/#geolocatecontrol).

Either Mapbox GL JS v1.13.1 or [MapLibre v1.14.0](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/) is recommended. Version 2.0+ of Mapbox GL JS brings [higher costs and a less open licence](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#pricing).
